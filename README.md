Inspeckage is a tool developed to offer dynamic analysis of Android applications. By applying hooks to functions of the Android API, Inspeckage will help you understand what an Android application is doing at runtime. 

Features
---------------

With Inspeckage, we can get a good amount of information about the application's behavior:

== Information gathering

* Requested Permissions;
* App Permissions;
* Shared Libraries;
* Exported and Non-exported Activities, Content Providers,Broadcast Receivers and Services;
* Check if the app is debuggable or not;
* Version, UID and GIDs;
* etc.

== Hooks (so far)

With the hooks, we can see what the application is doing in real time:

* Shared Preferences (log and file);
* Serialization;
* Crypto;
* Hashes;
* SQLite;
* HTTP (an HTTP proxy tool is still the best alternative);
* File System;
* Miscellaneous (Clipboard, URL.Parse());
* WebView;
* IPC;
* + Hooks (add new hooks dynamically)

== Actions

With Xposed it's possible to perform actions such as start a unexported activity and much else:

* Start any activity (exported and unexported);
* Call any provider (exported and unexported);
* Disable FLAG_SECURE;
* SSL uncheck;
* Start, stop and restart the application.

== Extras

* APK Download;
* View the app's directory tree;
* Download the app's files;
* Download the output generated by hooks in text file format;
* Take a screen capture;

== Configuration

Even though our tool has some hooks to the HTTP libraries, using an external proxy tool is still the best option to analyze the app's traffic. With Inspeckage, you can:

* Add a proxy to the target app;
* Enable and disable proxy;
* Add entries in the arp table.

== Logcat

Logcat.html page. A experimental page with websocket to show some information from the logcat.
